# RAILWAY-TRACK-INSPECTION-AND-AUTOMATIC-GATE-CROSSING-CONTROL-SYSTEM
The project enhances railway safety with a dual system: one detects track cracks using IR sensors and sends GPS-GSM alerts; the other automates gate control via IR detection and a servo motor. Arduino integration enables smooth control, reducing human effort and improving rail safety.
